// Even though we have been using Lambdas in the above example in various ways, it is important to note that a Lambda does not exist at runtime. The runtime effect of a Lambda is the generation of an object, which is known as closure. The difference between a Lambda and the corresponding closure is similar to the distinction between a class and an instance of the class. A class exists only in the source code while the objects created from it exist at runtime.
